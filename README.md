# Emotion dectection from text
The project aims to create a **Machine Learning** powered model which is capable of classifying the emotions of the text (in the form of short quotes/comments) with predefined labels of emotions.

Emotion detection, also known as sentiment analysis, is now one of the most attractive subfields of Machine Learning, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its wide applications in many aspects of modern life, such as providing emotional information to help people developing insights or making decisions. In this project, we specifically try to convey the main emotion of a comment sentence. Generally, we expect the model to be able to take the input sentence in the form of short comments and returns its major emotion(s), corresponding to one of the predefined labels.

Our approach to solving this problem is to split it into two halves:

  1.   Data Preprocessing
  2.   Model training and Result

For detail of each half, please go into the section

The dataset we use in this project is obtained from Kaggle: [EDFT Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp)
